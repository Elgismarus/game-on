## Intro
A web application where people can let others know they would like to play a game (foosball, ping pong etc.)


This application runs on Node.JSand uses the Socket.IO library to send messages via WebSockets. 


## Install
- Install node
- run the index.js file using "node index.js"


## Usage
- Access via a browser locally using http://localhost:3000
- When the page loads you need to choose to allow the page to send you notifications.
- Add your name and click "Notify Me". You will be notified when 4 "registrations" occur. 
- You can add more than one "registration" from a single browser.
- There is also a very basic chat feature you can use without signing up for a game.
- Have fun :)
